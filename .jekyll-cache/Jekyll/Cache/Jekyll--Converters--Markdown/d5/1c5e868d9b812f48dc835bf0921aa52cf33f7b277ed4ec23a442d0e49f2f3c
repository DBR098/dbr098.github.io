I"Ì<p>Hi, my name is Denny and this blog will be the journal where youâ€™ll be able to see the progress I make in this cybersecurity world.</p>

<p>The goal of this blog is to show anyone whoâ€™s learning from zero, or almost zero, how Iâ€™m progressing.</p>

<h3 id="my-background">My background</h3>
<p>Like I said before, I know a very little about cybersecurity. But, for me, that doesnâ€™t matter as long as you have interest in learning about it.
Almost everything I know by know are things Iâ€™ve learned during my university days. Most of those concepts are theorical and one of my goals is to apply them.</p>

<h3 id="my-motivation">My motivation</h3>
<p>If I can say one thing about cybersecurity is that everyone Iâ€™ve seen who is envolved in it is very passional about it. They love to learn new concepts and put them into practice.
From the first moment I went to cybersecurity classes in my university, my teacher was very passionate about it and it really caught my interest in this world.</p>

<p>Outside the university I enjoy watching cybersecurity content. Hereâ€™s 3 creators I really like:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/s4vitar">S4vitar</a>: Heâ€™s a spanish cybersecurity content creator and the one I watch the most. He streams every day and makes videos from time to time. You can learn a lot only by listening to what heâ€™s saying and, one of the most important things, heâ€™s very entertaining to watch.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/networkchuck">NetworkChuck</a>: Heâ€™s very famous (2M youtube subscribers by the time Iâ€™m writing this) and, in my opinion, makes sense. He has everything you need to learn: full courses uploaded to his channel for free, series about learning from 0, educational contentâ€¦ He also does it in a very entertaining way, which makes it easier to learn. He uploads a few videos every week and can be about anything: one day you get a course, the next day one how to create a secure network and the list goes on.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/JohnHammond010">John Hammond</a>: Very different to the last 2, his videos last for about 1 hour and are very technical. He also interviews people from the cybersecurity world to help people and give them a perspective about this world. The subject of his videos is mainly exploit vulnerabilities from different sources.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-goals">My goals</h3>
<p>At the time Iâ€™m writing this, my main goal is to learn. To do it, I use HackTheBox Academy, a platform where you can learn about cybersecurity for free.
<em>Student tip:</em> if you have a student email use it so you can access the Student subscription which, for 7 euros you can access almost every module.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Hack the Box is better than other platforms because it lets you learn for free and, if you want to, you can pay to learn more. Also, they give you a virtual machine that youâ€™ll be able to use once per day (or unlimited times if you pay for a subscription). Also, other platforms who are about the same topic, are not as secure as Hack the Box is.</p>

<p>Once Iâ€™ve learnt enough, my goal is to achieve certain certifications. Some certifications Iâ€™d be interested in are eJPT (Junior Penetration Tester), eCPPT (Certified Professional Penetration Tester) and some others that can certify what Iâ€™ve learned through my journey. After that, I would like to certificate into OSWP (Offensive Security Wireless Professional) and OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional).</p>
