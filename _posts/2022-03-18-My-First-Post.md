Hi, my name is Denny and this blog will be the journal where you'll be able to see the progress I make in this cybersecurity world.

The goal of this blog is to show anyone who's learning from zero, or almost zero, how I'm progressing.

### My background
Like I said before, I know a very little about cybersecurity. But, for me, that doesn't matter as long as you have an interest in learning about it.
Almost everything I know by now are the things I've learned during my university days. Most of those concepts are theoretical and one of my goals is to apply them.

### My motivation
If I can say one thing about cybersecurity is that everyone I've seen who is involved in it is very passionate about it. They love to learn new concepts and put them into practice.
From the first moment I went to cybersecurity classes at my university, my teacher was very passionate about it and it really caught my interest in this world.

Outside the university I enjoy watching cybersecurity content. Here's 3 creators I really like:
*   [S4vitar](https://www.youtube.com/s4vitar): He's a Spanish cybersecurity content creator and the one I watch the most. He streams every day and makes videos from time to time. You can learn a lot only by listening to what he's saying and, one of the most important things, he's very entertaining to watch.
*   [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/networkchuck): He's very famous (2M YouTube subscribers by the time I'm writing this) and, in my opinion, makes sense. He has everything you need to learn: full courses uploaded to his channel for free, series about learning from 0, educational content... He also does it in a very entertaining way, which makes it easier to learn. He uploads a few videos every week and can be about anything: one day you get a course, the next day one how to create a secure network and the list goes on.
*   [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/JohnHammond010): Very different to the last 2, his videos last for about 1 hour and are very technical. He also interviews people from the cybersecurity world to help people and give them a perspective about this world. The subject of his videos is mainly exploiting vulnerabilities from different sources.

### My goals
Right now, my main goal is to learn. To do it, I use HackTheBox Academy, a platform where you can learn about cybersecurity for free.
*Student tip:* if you have a student email use it so you can access the Student subscription, which, for 7 euros you can access almost every module.

In my opinion, Hack the Box is better than other platforms because it lets you learn for free and, if you want to, you can pay to learn more. Also, they give you a virtual machine that you'll be able to use once per day (or unlimited times if you pay for a subscription). Also, other platforms who are about the same topic, are not as secure as Hack the Box is.


Once I'd learned enough, my goal is to achieve certain certifications. Some certifications I'd be interested in are eJPT (Junior Penetration Tester), eCPPT (Certified Professional Penetration Tester) and some others that can certify what I've learned through my journey. After that, I would like to certificate into OSWP (Offensive Security Wireless Professional) and OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional).
